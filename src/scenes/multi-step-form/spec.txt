We are implementing multi-step forms for estimate modules in the application. Here's the specific task breakdown:
The problem:
Some estimate module forms (like ElectricityForm.tsx) have too many form elements
These forms don't fit well in the new layout format recently implemented
The forms are too crowded
The solution:
Convert the crowded forms into multi-step forms
Keep all existing functionality intact
Only reorganize the form elements to fit the layout better
Technical context:
The forms are in src/scenes under module-specific directories (e.g., 'electricity')
The app uses Formik for form handling
There's an existing 'multi-step-form' folder in src/scenes where new components should go
We should leverage existing Formik implementation unless it's unnecessarily complex
Goal:
Clean up form elements to fit the new layout neatly
Use multi-step forms as a simple solution to this layout problem
No need to re-evaluate or change existing functionality
